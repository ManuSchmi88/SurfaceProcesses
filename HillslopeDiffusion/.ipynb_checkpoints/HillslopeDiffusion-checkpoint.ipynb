    "The most simple way to start this task is the so-called 'hillslope diffusion' equation, which explains how sediment is transported down a hillslope by e.g soil creep, rainsplash, etc.. It is assumed that all those processes are in first-order driven by gravity and, like all diffusion processes, are driven by a 'Gradient'. If you think about what gradient in a landscape exists which directly links to gravity? Right, the elevation! So set up the equation.\n",
