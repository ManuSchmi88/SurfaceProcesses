    "The most simple way to start this task is the so-called 'hillslope diffusion' equation, which explains how sediment is transported down a hillslope by e.g soil creep, rainsplash, etc.. It is assumed that all those processes are in first-order driven by gravity and, like all diffusion processes, are driven by a 'Gradient'. If you think about what gradient in a landscape exists which directly links to gravity? Right, the elevation! So set up the equation.\n",

Those processes happen over such a long timescale and at such a slow rate, that it is nearly impossible to constrain for each landscape. So we could not use the last equation. Good thing is, at te beginning we introduced an equation for q! So, we just combine those two equationd and are ready to rumble: \n",
